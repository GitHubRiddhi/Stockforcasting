## About Stock Forecasting 
  Stock forecasting uses historical data, algorithms, and statistical models to predict future price movements. By analyzing patterns, we aim to forecast price trends to assist investors in making data-driven decisions.


## How It Works
  Our tool uses machine learning algorithms to predict future stock prices. Simply enter the ticker symbol of the stock you're interested in, and our model will generate a forecast along with a graphical representation of future trends.
